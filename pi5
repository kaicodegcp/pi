🚀 CDS 3.5.4 Deployment to UAT & Spark 3.5 Validation with Multi-Python Support
Description

This week, the EAP Engineering team successfully deployed the Cloudera Data Services (CDS) 3.5.4 parcel (1.5.5-h107) to the UAT Fish Taco cluster (CDP 7.1.9), marking a critical milestone in Spark modernization efforts. Following deployment, an extensive validation was completed across Python 3.8, 3.9, and 3.11 environments to ensure compatibility for PySpark jobs.

In parallel, key artifacts including the Spark 3.3 vs 3.5 Delta Matrix, Migration Checklist, and Application Impact Notes were published to the internal Confluence space to enable seamless transition for application teams.

✅ Key Achievements

📦 Deployed CDS 3.5.4 parcels to UAT (CDP 7.1.9) for Spark-based workloads.

🧪 Validated PySpark compatibility with Python 3.8, 3.9, and 3.11:

Verified successful job runs across environments.

Ensured CDS Spark and Python integration is stable and production-ready.

📝 Published internal Confluence pages to support application teams:

Regression Test Plan & Diff Matrix

🎯 Benefits to the Platform & App Teams

Enables modern PySpark development with expanded syntax, Arrow UDF support, and HyperLogLog in Spark 3.5.

Reduces long-term risk by aligning with Cloudera’s recommended upgrade path (CDS 3.3 EOL by Aug 2026).

Empowers application teams with ready documentation and migration guidance, reducing onboarding time.

📌 Next Steps

🧪 Final round of validations and soak tests in UAT.

🚀 Plan & execute Production rollout post UAT sign-off.

📣 Share a formal migration advisory to all app teams with Python version upgrade guidance.
